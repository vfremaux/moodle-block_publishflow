<h2>Synchronising Platforms</h2>
<h3>Field Synchronising</h3>

<p>This operation affects custom profile fields.</p>

<p>It will check that every know mnet host has it's appropriate custom field in the database.</p>

<p>If not, the field will be created. The purpose of this operation is to simplify the user transfers between platforms.</p>

<p>Though the fields are created, no users are associated with it. The network privileges must still be assigned.</p>
