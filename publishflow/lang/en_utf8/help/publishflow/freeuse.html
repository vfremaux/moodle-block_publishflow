<h2>Using "free use" learning pathes sessions</h2>

<p>Any user in the Pairformance model can freely have use of learning pathes for a local team. This mode allows any registered and accredited user to deploy and take ownership of a working session instanciating a Learning Path.</p>

<p>This deploymnt will create a complet working space on the user's node, copying the full pedagogic scenario to the created workplace. The initiator of the deployment will be enrolled as trainer within the new working place, and will be allowed to enroll trainees.</p>

<p>The "free use" deployment will naturally target the origin node of the requirer.</p>

<p>When the deployment comes to end, you will be invited to browse to the newly created training environment.</p>
